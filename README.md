    3. Run RabbitMQ server



    4. Go to the project folder
    5. Run the project (Notice: this may take ages but be patient ;) )



    6. After everything is done, open a browser and browse http://localhost:9000
    7. To start the game, you need to login with your facebook account. Since, the facebook app id is sandbox, you need to let me know to give you the permission
    8. You can start another browser and login with another (privileged) facebook account.
    9. Now you can search for each other by facebook display name. After clicking on the search result, the game will start
